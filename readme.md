# Maze Solver Visualizer

An interactive Python application that generates and solves mazes through visual demonstration.
Built with Tkinter, this program creates randomized mazes and showcases pathfinding algorithms in
action. The solver systematically discovers the optimal route from start to finish.

This project implements core concepts related to graph data structures and associated algorithms,
allowing the user to visualize maze-solving techniques through the Tkinter graphical interface.
Features include:

- Real-time maze generation using randomized algorithms
- Step-by-step visualization of the solving process
- Interactive GUI built with Python's Tkinter library

The project code assists in understanding pathfinding algorithms in a practical, engaging way.
