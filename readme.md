# Maze Solver Visualizer

An interactive Python application that generates and solves mazes through visual demonstration.
Built with Tkinter, this program creates randomized mazes and showcases pathfinding algorithms in
action. Watch as the solver systematically discovers the optimal route from start to finish!

This project implements core concepts from Algorithms and Data Structures, bringing maze-solving
techniques to life through an intuitive graphical interface. Features include:

- Real-time maze generation using randomized algorithms
- Step-by-step visualization of the solving process
- Interactive GUI built with Python's Tkinter library

Perfect for understanding pathfinding algorithms in a practical, engaging context.
